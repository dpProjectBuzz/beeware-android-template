BeeWare Android Template
========================

A template for starting a native Android app using Python and the BeeWare tools.

More specifically, it uses `VOC`_ for compiling Python into Java bytecode
and `Briefcase`_ to package as an Android app.

Using this template
-------------------

1. Install `cookiecutter`_. This is a tool used to bootstrap complex project
   templates::

    $ pip install cookiecutter

2. Run ``cookiecutter`` on this template::

    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/eliasdorneles/beeware-android-template

3. Add your code to the project.

4. Install `Briefcase`_. This is the tool that will produce a version of your
   project that can be deployed to specific platforms::

    $ pip install briefcase

5. Use Briefcase to generate the Android artifacts::

    $ python setup.py android

6. Build and run your app using Gradle::

   $ (cd android && ./gradlew run)
